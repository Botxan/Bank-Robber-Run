MODO: 'anidado' (nested)

Main Functions-> access, use, pick up, view, help, exit and timer.

Main idea:
  - Assalt the vault
  - Need access to differents rooms(folders) to obtain the cards to get the vault.
  - Rooms will have different persmissions and hidden object to advance.
  - The main actor will have 'logs' to save the progress 
  - Battles to obtain the minimum to open the vault. 
  - One inventory for each participant. If you exit the game, you can save all you obtain for the nest time.
