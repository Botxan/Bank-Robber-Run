**Description**

The player takes on the role of a member of a gang that intends to rob a bank.

The bank is expecting an electrician in one hour, as there has been a power outage in the basement of the bank. The player will then have that time to infiltrate, move around the bank and get hold of the resources needed to gain access to the vault room. But this will not be a piece of cake, as the player will have to dodge the security measures typical of a bank of that caliber (guards, lasers, cameras... even the director himself).

You can find all the documentation and storyline of the project [here](https://github.com/Botxan/Bank-Robber-Run/blob/main/BANK-ROBBER-RUN%20-%20Report.pdf).
