*You knock on the door*
Hey, honey, you want something?

A:Well, I’m new at the bank, and I’m taking a walk to meet my mates. I brought you coffee, will you?
B:The boss just sent me, apparently last month’s balance doesn’t add up, and he wants to talk to you. He says go now.
C:No, nothing, I’m sorry.
D:*Try to knock her out*

Oh sure sweetie. *Slip* Mocha...mm..., my favorite!

A:Like mine! Although I will save it for a little later, it does nothing that I have taken one.
B:Do you know that mocca, also called mocaccino, is a chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant of a café latte commonly served in a glass rather than a mug?

Wow, I remember the accounts were good... and you say it has to be right now? I’m a little busy...

C:The boss seemed pretty upset, if I were you I wouldn’t keep him waiting.
D:Well, I guess he can wait.

Well I’m afraid he’ll have to wait, I have a customer on the phone and we’re about to close an investment of 125K €. The boss will understand. If you need anything else, I’ll be in my office.
