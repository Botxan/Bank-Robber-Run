You are now in the security room. Like in the movies, the security room full of monitors, red buttons and of course, the fucking sleeping guard, what a joke. Reminds me of a professor I had when I studied computer engineering.
The ventilation ducts are literally in the roof, so it will be difficult to access them from here.
